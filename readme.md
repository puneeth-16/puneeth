This prgram is for manage student record system.
This program contains CRUD (Create,View,Update,Delete) operations on the the student data.
Here we uses ArrayList to store data in a memory.
Here we used JDBC(Java DataBase Connectivity) concept to connect the student record to store the data in the database.
All the changes done using CRUD operations on student record are stored in the DataBase.
We can apply the changes after storng into the DataBase.
Here we used Switch Conditions to choose the user to perform any operations.
No view,update,delete operations if the record is empty. After all the records are filled then the operations are going to work.
Here the data is not saved permanently.
