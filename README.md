The program begins by importing the Scanner class to take user input from the console.
Here class is named as calculator and the main method which execute the code.
Inside the main method we declared some variables with there datatypes, and the scanner class creates a Scanner object named input.
Here scanner object named as input takes the values from the user in console and stores in the declared variables.
A do-while loop is used to perform multiple operations repeatedly until the user exits.
User is able to enter the operators(+,-,*,/) to perform task.
If users enters wrong operator it shows "entered operator is not valid".
Here we use switch condition to perfrom operation on the entered operators.
If the operation is valid then it print result.
after genterationg output it asks to continue or not, If the answer is to continue the it perform next operation or else it exits from the operation.
While exiting from the operation it shows calculator exited.
